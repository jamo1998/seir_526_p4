# Project 4
Name of App: What Next
Team: Jameson Aardalen
New Tech: Redux and Typescript

1. I already have some redux under my belt, I have already been practicing with how
redux and typescript can be implemented together

2. My goal with this project is to provide my users with a convenient way to create, track, and complete daily tasks

3. My user is any hardworking individual who feels they have too many tasks on their hand to keep track of and effectively get anything done. With COVID giving everyone more free time than they need, What Next helps the user stay on track every day to make sure the things that need to get done are getting done.

4. Incorporating Redux with Typescript will be the biggest challenge, when you use redux with typescript you need to annotate the type of action being created, and annotate what the reducer will return when that action is called.
